## Project Overview

## Data

### MNIST


- Using MNIST dataset, which is bacis to machine learning, you can learn the core concepts of NLP and Computer vision.
- Generated arithmetic equations which has random length, [code](https://github.com/you-just-want-attention/image-captioning/blob/master/utils/dataset.py)
    * SerializationDataset: Arrange the data
    * CalculationDataset: Automatically make operations
    * ClassificationDataset: Making data lable, which is result of arithmetic
